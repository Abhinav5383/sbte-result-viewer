# SBTE Results viewer

Try it out: https://sbte-results.devabhinav.online

This is a set of tools that can
- Download the sbte result pdfs automatically in bulk
- Extract marks data from the pdfs and store them in a json file
- Create a web page to show the resutls in a nice UI

The built html file is standalone, it doesn't need to load data from anywhere else. The results json file is gzipped and embedded in the html file itself.
